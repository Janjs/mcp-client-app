## Electron App Not Fully Closing Issue (3/7/2025, 1:11:08 AM)

_**User**_

We are working on this electron application that is an implementation of model context protocol,

For some reason when I close the app instance it remains active in my macbook tray, and if I click the icon on the dock it kind of reopens the process on the terminal, even though I already closed it

<think>The user is experiencing an issue with an Electron application that's implementing the "model context protocol". When they close the app, it's not fully terminating - it remains in the macOS system tray, and clicking the icon in the dock seems to reopen the process in the terminal even after they've closed it.

This is a common issue with Electron apps where the app might not be properly handling the quit/exit events or perhaps the window is being hidden instead of the app fully exiting.

To solve this, I need to:
1. Understand the codebase structure
2. Find the main Electron process code
3. Look for app quit/exit event handling
4. Check how window close events are being handled
5. Propose a fix to ensure the app fully terminates when closed

Let me start by exploring the codebase structure to get a better understanding of the project.</think>Good afternoon, Sir. I understand you're experiencing an issue with your Electron application where it remains active in the tray after closing, and clicking the dock icon reopens it despite your attempts to close it. Let's investigate and fix this issue for you, Mr. RegiByte.

First, let me explore the structure of your project to better understand the codebase.

Let's examine the source directory to locate the main Electron process code:

Perfect. In Electron applications, the "main" directory typically contains the main process code that handles application lifecycle events. Let's examine that directory:

Let's check the main index.ts file, which is likely the entry point for the Electron application and handles the application lifecycle:

I've found the issue, Sir. The problem is in how the application handles window closure on macOS. Looking at lines 104-109:

```typescript
// Quit when all windows are closed, except on macOS.
// There, it's common for applications and their menu bar
// to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q.
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
})
```

This is standard Electron behavior for macOS applications - when you close the window, the application itself remains running in the background. However, since you'd like the application to fully quit when closed, I'll modify this code to ensure the app quits completely on window closure, even on macOS.

Let me update the file for you:

---

```diff
  })
  
- // Quit when all windows are closed, except on macOS.
- // There, it's common for applications and their menu bar
- // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q.
+ // Quit when all windows are closed, even on macOS.
+ // This differs from the standard macOS app behavior, but ensures the app fully quits when closed
  app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
-   if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
-     app.quit()
-   }
+   app.quit()
  })
  
```

Now let's also check if there might be anything in the app's tray configuration that could be keeping it alive. Let's look for any tray-related code:

Let me check if there might be any 'hide' behavior instead of actual quitting:

Let me try a simpler search:

I've already made the key fix by modifying the 'window-all-closed' event handler to quit the application even on macOS. Let's also check if there are any additional background processes or services that might be keeping the app running:

            <summary>Listed directory src/main/services â€¢ **2** results</summary>

Let's make sure we're handling the actual app quit correctly in the McpManager service since it seems to manage connections:

---

_****_

Read file: src/main/services/McpManager.ts

---

_****_

Let's look at the disconnectAll method to make sure it's handling cleanup properly:

---

_****_

Read file: src/main/services/McpManager.ts

Now let's also check the disconnectFromServer method:

Read file: src/main/services/McpManager.ts

Based on my investigation, Sir, I've made a crucial change to your application's quit behavior. The primary issue was that the app was following the standard macOS behavior pattern, where closing all windows doesn't actually quit the application (unlike on Windows and Linux).

I've modified the code in `src/main/index.ts` to make the application fully quit when all windows are closed, even on macOS, by removing the conditional check for platform type in the 'window-all-closed' event handler.

Here's a summary of what I changed:
- Modified the 'window-all-closed' event handler to call `app.quit()` unconditionally, even on macOS
- I looked for any other potential issues in tray implementations or hidden windows but didn't find any

This fix should ensure that when you close the application window, the entire application will terminate completely instead of remaining active in the background.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the application's quit behavior, Mr. RegiByte?
